# IDEAS
- checkbox for "Interpret results as tuples" or not
- more user friendly grid (like mentioned by Oscar W)
- how do custom widgets work if the user does not want to handle all the custom events?
- allow searching by tuple
- make .deb
- allow viewing the full text of truncated strings/binary
- focus view-full-text-window when the text changes...
- is Bin doing unncessary subscriptions because it doesn't ever emit patch = Keep ?
