# IDEAS
- checkbox for "Interpret results as tuples" or not
- more user friendly grid (like mentioned by Oscar W)
- how do custom widgets work if the user does not want to handle all the custom events?
- allow searching by tuple for all kinds of tuple element, not just none/text/bytes
- is Bin doing unncessary subscriptions because it doesn't ever emit patch = Keep ?
